-22-12-2018 : Initial release

-24-12-2018 : Minor code changes, mostly the NSudo existence/path query (also case insensitive now) for complete services optimization.

-17-01-2019 : Optimize Next Gen v2, complete re-write.
	-Now includes a Main Menu to apply full optimization or only parts of the script (cf spoiler screenshot in MDL forum thread).
	-Merged Server and LTSC in one unique .bat: Windows edition is detected inside the script.
	-Added Power Management Settings in "Performances settings task".
	-Services backup is now (much) faster.
	-Included NSudo to apply complete services optimization.
	-Added Trim (as an Option), only for system drive. Note: if your C:\ drive isn't a SSD, command will not proceed. So, don't worry if you pressed yes by mistake, it won't run HDD defrag...
	-Firefox Policies and Template are now optional (requested by PsychedelicShaman ).
	-Background apps, Camera and Microphone are now set to "User is in control" in Group Policy (thanks to PsychedelicShaman ).
	-Few registry tweaks added (like Shutdown Event Tracer and DisableCAD for Server).
	-Resetting Group Policy Security Settings is now optional. Note: if you choose to reset, don't worry, Group Policy Security Settings and Security database are also saved (cf spoiler notes).
	-Added few security settings (rights delegation and password policy). 
		Note : Strong password policy is ON by default on Windows Server, not verified yet in LTSC.
	-Backup folder with settings and scripts is now saved in script folder (instead of Desktop).
	-Rewrote all included scripts, and added some more. Note: "Restore Group Policy from backup" and "Optimize Group Policy" scripts obviously requires to keep the same folder structure.
	-Added nice colors and title to tittle bar (cf screenshot). ANSI Escape sequences (supported since Threshold 2 Update) was fun in the beginning, but rapidely ended up a nightmare to have it set perfect in script...
		Check MSDN page for reference abour cursor position and colors:
		https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/console-virtual-terminal-sequences 
	-Added Powershell command to resize batch window without resizing buffer height.
	-Added Ultimate Performance PowerScheme setting in Power Management, to set it/or create Powerscheme if missing (and restore default GUID). 
		There is a annoying bug in windows, if you ever change Powerscheme through powercfg /S command, Ultimate Performance PowerScheme vanishes. 
		You can easily recreate it with this command: powercfg -duplicatescheme 9a42b02-d5df-448d-aa00-03f14749eb61, but it then creates a new GUID in registry...
		Too ugly! Had to fix that...You'll have Ultimate Performance Powerschem WITH default/original GUID in registry.

-21-01-2019 : Optimize Next Gen v2.5
	-New Fast option: Full optimization with no prompts nor backups. 
		Similar to Optimize NextGen v.1 but with the added new functions.
		Note: TRIM is excluded from fast optimization (you don't need to trim that often).
	-New Separate Options in the Main Menu : Telemetry only, Privacy only, TRIM (cf main menu screenshot)
	-Added HID selective suspend setting, to disable/untick "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" for HID Devices under Power Management tab in Device Manager:
	-Added Memory Compression and PageCombining, only for Windows Server (cf spoiler screenshots).
	-Fixed a missing double quote. Not that important, it was just making one of the restore functions exit at the end of the process, instead of pause/going to start menu.

-16-02-2019: Optimize NextGen v2.6
	-Added few "privacy" Group Policy settings
	-Fixed bug introduced in v2.5 while running TRIM command (forgot to "escape" parenthesis in the script)

-16-04-2019: Optimize NextGen v3.0
	-Compatibility with other Windows 10 editions (services optimization feature not available yet)
	-Separate Restore and Optimize menus
	-New feature: Enable write caching on all disks. Normally one needs to do it manually in device manager for each drive.
	-Now ask if the user wants to enable or disable file and printer sharing required services (disabled by default in Fast mode).
	-At the beginning scans if Wlan Service exists, and then if any Wifi is connected, to disable (or ask to disable) Wlan service during later services optimization.
	-New "custom policy set", with 2 new policies: Enable or disable storage sense, Remove power button from login screen (hide or force allow/show, which I needed personally)
	-Some Group Policy settings added


-20-05-2019: Optimize NextGen v3.5
	-Compressed everything in one simple SFX file ("auto extract" .exe), easier to store.
	-Now accepting switches. 
		Switches added: /fast /full /secret
		/fast=fast mode (no backup or choices)
		/full=full mode (every optimization with choices)
		/secret=fast mode with hidden console, except restart countdown and prompt at the end.	
	Note: If you prefer to run .bat instead, just open/extract .exe with 7zip or winrar. 
	.bat script also accepts switches, same functionalities, with just a cosmetic difference: shell/console "changes" are apparent.

	-Added a script to quickly create .exe shortcuts with all switches.
	-Added (and modified a bit) Indexing options setting, cf here: https://github.com/Thdub/Set_Indexing_Options

-05-06-2019: Optimize NextGen v3.6
	-Firefox Template updated to v1.7, changelog here: https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates/releases
		.adml (policy definitions) are now available in different languages (de, en, es, it, sp) and will be imported according to your OS language.
	-Removed some Firefox policies (locked values) and few personal settings I had forgotten to remove, like https://google.com/ncr Home Page.
	-Added /offline switch for offline scenarios: deployment/post-install script, logon/logoff script...
		Usage: Optimize_NextGen_MDL.exe /offline, or Optimize_NextGen_MDL.bat /offline (if you extracted .bat from SFX archive).
		You can also use the shortcuts creation script provided, for easier launch.
	-Small fixes:
		-in Miscellaneous section, UI and keyboard was set to EN-US with French Layout (my own settings, sorry...in a 2000+lines scripts it's hard to think of everything)
		-Deleted the whole keyboard part for now, including NUMLOCK at startup ("InitialKeyboardIndicators"= 2), "KeyboardDelay" and "KeyboardSpeed"
		-One robocopy command wasn't hidden ( >nul missing)
		-Added User Name to "user accounts to be trusted for delegation" (security settings). Just a precaution, Authenticated Users and Administrator already had delegation rights (in previous script versions). Note: This setting is mandatory on Windows Server if you want to be able to change/update User Policy, you need at least Authenticated User or Administrator (without s).

-08-06-2019 : Optimize NextGen v3.7
	-Modified Microsoft account policy (security setting) to: "Users can't add Microsoft accounts", to avoid people using microsoft account being 
	locked out.
	-Added option to set Group Policy again or to reset Group Policy after registry tweak removing (Restore menu):
		Some important registry settings are redundantly included as Group Policy settings. If you launched full/fast optimization or Group Policy single task before, the tweaks you just removed are still stored as GPO, which means that while tweaks were removed, a future "GpUpdate" command would re-add them.
		In this case (only), it's better to launch Group Policy task again with these only the registry tweaks removed, or to reset Group Policy totally. 
		So, I made 4 new policy files without those registry settings and added option to set again, reset Group Policy totally, or leave like this.
	-Minor cosmetic changes

-08-06-2019 : Optimize NextGen v3.8
	-Added DeviceCleanup cmdline tool:
		https://www.uwe-sieber.de/misc_tools_e.html#devicecleanup
       		Each once attached device leaves an entry in the Windows device management. 
		By means of the Windows device manager you can delete one by one only. 
		With this tool you can delete multiple or all non-present devices.

-11-06-2019 : Optimize NextGen v3.8.2
	-Added event viewer logs clearing to end cleaning task.

-07-07-2019 : Optimize NextGen v3.8.5
	-Added more privacy settings (in miscellaneous section for now). 
 	
-08-07-2019 : Optimize NextGen v3.8.6
 	-Cleared duplicates/redundant settings
	-Updated "Disable scheduled tasks" (a lot where added).

-17-07-2019 : Optimize NextGen v3.9.5
	-Major code improvment (learning every day...)
	- Optional Microsoft Store and games settings :
		Since some people use the Store, and even add Store to LTSC (still, wanting performances and privacy ?!?) I decided to add this as an option (instead of sending customized versions)
		This was not the purpose of the script and I clearly stated for who/what it is targeted, but...yeah (some people won't read anyway)
		It will query for Microsoft.StorePurchaseApp, and if detected/installed ask the user if he wants to apply or bypass store and apps settings.
		Made it clear : after the prompt, added (Choose NO if you use the store)
		Choosing YES will block store, store apps and games, and disable Microsoft Account creation (You can still logon with a previously created Microsoft Account though)
		If the user chooses to bypass store settings, it will then ask if he wants to apply or bypass games settings.
		Clear also : added (choose NO if you play games)
		Choosing NO will keep gamebar, leave xboxsave scheduled task enabled etc. while YES will set all "game related" tweaks.
	- Added Game Explorer deactivation (and of course restoration, in restore menu) : gameux.dll injects into games at startup and connects to MS servers.
		It just renames .dll as .dll.bak to avoid leaking infos to ms servers.
		Note: if you set this option, you will then see an (harmless) error in event viewer log:
		Error setting traits on Provider {8444a4fb-d8d3-4f38-84f8-89960a1ef12f}, haven't found better solution for now.
		Note2: If you previously chose to bypass games settings, this option is not proposed.
	- Added more privacy settings (Thanks to some fellow MDL members ;) and Blackbird dev)
	- New services startup configuration backup: Using now a customized vbs script which will save startup configuration as .bat and .reg file
		.reg file provides delayed start detection, and on top of that backup task is (a lot) faster. 
		(Thanks to Ramesh Srinivasan for tbe original script)
	- Setting indexing options is also faster, and custom path indexing made - I hope - bulletproof (if you hit cancel or enter path twice for ex.)
	- Keyboard improvments: Keyboard speed (enjoy fast keyboard!), and numlock set ON at startup (never understood why it wasn't the case by default)
	- Added clear event viewer log option.
	- Firefox Policy Template updated to v1.8 (Thanks to Michael Kaply)
		https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates/releases
	- Added Scheduled Tasks script (if you want to disable scheduled tasks outside main script)
	- Updated Registry Tweak script with latest tweaks. 
		Note: This is the script provided to (re)apply tweaks outside main script.
		Haven't had time yet to update "Restore Tweaks" script, it's a bit long, sorry.
		Neither had to update "remove registry tweaks" part in the main script.
		But few are missing, since most of the settings are set by GPO.
	- TRIM command will only run if system drive is detected as a SSD (before that, if would not do anything anyway if system isn't a SSD, but at the end it will be faster than if you chose YES)
	- Small bug fixes.
