# Optimize NextGen
OS performances optimization for Windows Server 2019, Windows 10 LTSC and Windows 10.

It is primarily designed for individual workstations with heavy workload, such as professional Audio or 3D applications. 
In short, systems used mainly for one task.

The goal is to optimize performances settings disabling useless functions and maximizing privacy, while favorizing whenever possible Group Policy settings for tweak reversibility and in order to keep "update resistant" settings (unlike registry tweaks).
    
Everything is fully reversible, either from main script, or with backed up files and scripts.

You can apply FULL optimization, or single optimization/restoration tasks from the 2 main menus (Optimize/Restore)

You can use these switches :
  /full (full script/interactive)   
  /fast (fast mode)
  /offline (same as fast mode but without restart prompt, for offline scenarios)

Note : It will only work with build 17763 (or above), either Server 2019 or LTSC, but also works with other Windows 10 editions now. I couldn't test services optimization for "regular" Windows 10 editions yet, so, for now, services configuration feature is disabled for these editions.
